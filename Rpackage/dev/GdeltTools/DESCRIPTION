Description: The GDELT V1 Event data set is over 41 GB now and growing 250 MB 
    a month. GDELT V2 Event data set is 30 GB and growing at about the same rate.
    The number of source articles has increased over time and unevenly 
    across countries. This package makes it easy to download a subset of that 
    data, then normalize that data to facilitate valid time series analysis.
